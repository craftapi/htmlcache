# HTML Cache plugin for Craft CMS

Generate HTML-file based caching for your Craft CMS

> Please note; this project is in BETA and unfinished. The current download works, but has no cache *control*, meaning the cache will not get refreshed. Use on your own risk.

## Installation

To install HTML Cache, follow these steps:

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `htmlcache-master` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2.  -OR- do a `git clone https://github.com/craftapi/htmlcache/htmlcache.git` directly into your `craft/plugins` folder.  You can then update it with `git pull`
3. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
4. The plugin folder should be named `htmlcache` for Craft to see it.  GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.

HTML Cache works on Craft 2.4.x and Craft 2.5.x.
